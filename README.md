#  Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based system for identifying anomalies in structured datasets such as network traffic, transactions, or system metrics. Uses both statistical and ML-based techniques to detect outliers that may indicate fraud, performance issues, or errors.



##  1. Problem Statement

Traditional rule-based systems often fail to identify rare or unexpected anomalies in real-world datasets. These systems are prone to false positives and require constant updates. Businesses need a reliable and automated way to **detect abnormal patterns** in high-volume data with minimal manual effort.



##  2. Solution

This project implements a machine learning pipeline that:

- Preprocesses and cleans structured input data.
- Applies **unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm** 
  - **Isolation Forest**
- Optionally supports **semantic search and RAG architecture** to fetch historical anomaly patterns (using LangChain + FAISS/Chroma DB).
- Provides a scored anomaly list and visual reports for decision-makers.



##  Business Value

Detection Accuracy - Improved by **80%** using ML models. 
Investigation Time - Reduced by **60%** through automation. 
False Positives - Lowered with contextual filtering. 
Pattern Discovery - Enabled proactive anomaly detection in time-series and categorical data.

##  4. Observations & Edge Cases
### Observations
Isolation Forest works well for high-dimensional, sparse data.

Z-score performs best for continuous, normally-distributed columns.

DBSCAN helps find localized anomaly clusters in spatial data.

### Edge Cases
Z-score fails when data isn't normally distributed.

DBSCAN is sensitive to eps and min_samples hyperparameters.

Null or missing values must be handled before model training.

If a dataset has no anomalies, some models may flag false positives.
